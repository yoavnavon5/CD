# CD
Circular Dichroism Data and Code.

Attached are .csv files, each corresponds to a measurement of a DNA sequence and an added peptide at different concentrations and different wavelengths of polarized light.
The columns refer to the concentrations (buffer relates to a measurement of a DNA only, the rest to an addition of a peptide), while the rows relate to the wavelength (in nm).
When downloading the files, one might place each one in a dedicated directory.

Attached are also the .py files for analyzing the CD data: the first file classifies the names of both DNA and peptides for further analyses; the second one plots the CD profiles of the buffer measurements (DNA alone, without a peptide); the third one analyzes the CD spectra peaks (extreme values) in relation to the wavelength and concentration; the fourth one classifies the data according to the peptides; and the fifth one classifies the data according to the DNA sequences.
